# Crowdfunding_ETL
This project was written by Pradiban Anthony, Mahreen Ayaz, Brandon Liu. In this project we used the files provided in the module for project 2, and built and ETL pipeline using python, pandas and mongodb. After creating the pipeline, we managed to produce four csvs. Using the csvs, we then created an ERD and a table schema. All related files are uploaded onto this repository.
